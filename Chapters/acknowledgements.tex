This thesis is the grand finale of a three-year adventure with many ups and downs. But you can't go through an adventure like this alone. It takes emotional support, competent advice and a lot of great moments of togetherness to finally reach the destination on such a journey. And finally being able to say: You have made it!

\noindent I thank my family, my friends, my supervisor Robin Rombach and everyone else who believed in me and was there for me when I needed them. Moreover, I thank all persons who did not get the attention they deserved during this time and yet were patient with me. At the end of the day, I can only say one thing:
\begin{center}
    \textbf{Without you all, this adventure would have been a different one!}
