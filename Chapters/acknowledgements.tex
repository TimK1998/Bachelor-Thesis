This thesis is the grand finale of a three-year adventure with many ups and downs. But you can't go through an adventure like this alone. It takes emotional support, competent advice and a lot of great moments of togetherness to finally reach the destination on such a journey. And finally being able to say: You have made it!

\noindent I thank my family, my friends and everyone else who believed in me and was there for me when I needed them. I would also like to thank all the people who did not get the attention they deserved during this time and yet were patient with me. At the end of the day, I can only say one thing:
\begin{center}
    \textbf{Without you, this adventure would have been a different one!}
